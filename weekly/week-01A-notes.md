# Week 1A: Course Introduction | JavaScript Review

Welcome to the course!

## I. Overview
Welcome to IGME-330 Rich Media Web Application Development I. In this course you will be building on top of IGME-230 and constructing compelling interactive experiences that can be viewed over the web. You will also be learning about how to build more robust and modular web software by utilizing more features of JavaScript ES6, and tools like node and npm. 


## II. Prerequisites
IGME-230 is a pre-requisite, and you should have a solid understanding of these topics:
- HTML/CSS, and be able to post web files to `people.rit.edu` - if you forgotten how, [here are the instructions](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/posting-to-banjo.md)
- Basic JavaScript and the Web Browser DOM (Document Object Model)

### \*\*Important - Before class begins\*\*
- Review the topics in these ten [IGME-230 Web App tutorials](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-230-Master/blob/master/notes/web-apps-0.md#section4) - most of this material should have been covered in your IGME-230 section. If you need a refresher on any of these topics, just go through the applicable tutorials at the link above. If you have any questions at all, or would like to have an assignment checked for accuracy, go ahead and reach out to me via email.


## III. Course Description & Topics
Official description from SIS: *This course provides students the opportunity to explore the design and development of Media Rich Internet Applications (MRIAs).  This course moves beyond client and server side web development, and explores issues of presentation, interactivity, persistence, and extensibility common among such applications.  Specifically, items explored include framework characteristics, data management, persistence, data binding, information manipulation, as well as data presentation.*

You can read about the [course topics](../topics.md) here.


## IV. Pedagogy (how this course is taught!)
- ***You need to review the week's lecture notes *prior* to attending class for that week***
- A typical classroom day will be:
    - a review of the days topics our Github lecture notes
    - a live demo by the professor that reinforces the day's topics
    - if time remains, students will be able to work on homework assignments
- The assignments given in this class break into two categories:
    - homework assignments or in-class exercises that focus narrowly on one or more concepts
    - three projects with more flexible requirements that allow you to exercise considerable freedom and creativity in demonstrating key skills and understanding
- A large part of this course is taught similar to a typical math course: there will be several small homework assignments given every week, and because these assignments build upon one another, it is essential that they be completed both on-time and in-order, thus they have strict due dates.
- Keep an eye on the dropboxes in myCourses for what and when things are due. HW assignments will not be accepted late without prior permission from the instructor:
    - if something comes up and you need an extension you need to get in touch with us ASAP *before* the assignment is due
    - **Reminder:** *all code files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) must be zipped when put in a dropbox, because otherwise myCourses strips out the JavaScript and CSS, and you will likely get a zero on the assignment*
- The due dates for these assignments will be clustered around the same days, often on Sunday night. This means that you should plan ahead, and not try to tackle them all in the last hour before they are due.
- Please get to class on time! Lectures will begin promptly at the start of class.
