1. What is ***Reactive Programming*** (see below)
1. In a ***MVVM*** Vue.js app - what is the (see below):
    - Model
    - View
    - ViewModel

## III. Reference
- **Reactive Programming** - I like the definition from [here](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2501666) - "Reactive programming has recently gained popularity as a paradigm that is well-suited for developing event-driven and interactive applications. It facilitates the development of such applications by providing abstractions to express time-varying values and automatically managing dependencies between such values."
- **MVVM ("Model–view–viewmodel")** - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-viewmodel - the ViewModel of MVVM is a value converter, meaning the view model is responsible for exposing (converting) the data objects from the model in such a way that objects are easily managed and presented. ViewModel handles data binding, ensuring that the data changed in the Model immediately affects the View layer and vice versa.
