# Week 6A - JavaScript Revealing Module Pattern

## I. Overview
- In the first part of today's demo, we will take 

- The start file is the completed version of the the "week 4 demo", which you hopefully created as you followed along with the demo. If not, the original start file is here: https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/demo-canvas-image-data.md - and you will need to watch the Week 4B "Canvas Image Data" videos to get the controls working.

Below is an external JS file that has some helpful code and variables in it. Some of this code we would like to keep public and visible elsewhere, some of it we want to hide away so it doesn't get mutuated or overwritten by code wriiten elsewhere.
But under ES5, all of this code is in either Script scope or Global scope, and thus vulnerable to being overwritten by code written elsewhere (it could also overwrite other code itself)
