# Week 13A - Storing data in cloud

## I. Topics
- [Project 3](../projects/project-3.md) requirements have been posted!
- Firebase exercises/demos:
  - [1 - Intro to Firebase](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-1.md)
  - [2 - Firebase Highscore App](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-2.md)
  - [3 - Firebase Highscore Viewer](https://github.com/tonethar/IGME-330-Master/blob/master/notes/firebase-3.md)
  
**Note:** There is not a mycourses dropbox for the Firebase exercises above, but if you do not follow along and understand what we are doing in these three Firebase chapters, you will have a difficult time meeting the cloud storage requirement of Project 3.
