We are moving into the third part of the course, where we will build data-driven applications. In the next few weeks we will cover the following concepts:
- intro (or review for some of you) of using web services
- creating our own web service
- utilizing multiple web services (such as google maps) to build a web service *mashup*
- storing data in the "cloud" via Firebase
- *data binding* - learning how to utilize "reactive" frameworks like Vue.js
